"""Submitter bridge across all DCC hosts.

This bridges AYON's publishing plugins to the unified ``BaseSubmitter`` defined
in ``deadline-cloud``. A single :class:`SubmitterBridge` works for every DCC
that provides a ``BaseSubmitter`` subclass (see
:mod:`ayon_deadline_cloud.api.submitter_registry`), so no per-host bridge code
is required.

    Works for any DCC with a ``BaseSubmitter`` subclass. The concrete class is

    expect.

        host_name: The name of the host application (e.g. "maya").
        instance_node: Optional host node path identifying the instance being
            submitted. Most DCCs resolve everything from the live scene and
            ignore this, but some (e.g. Houdini) resolve their settings and job
            template from a specific node (its ROP), so the publish side must
            seed it before ``get_settings()`` — the same way the create plugin
            does. When the submitter exposes ``set_rop_node_path()`` and a
            node is provided, it is seeded here.
